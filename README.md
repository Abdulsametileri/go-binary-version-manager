# Motivation

The projects I worked on used different versions of the `golangci-lint` and `mockery` libraries. When I use their
commands, inconsistent, strange errors occur.
I am aiming to solve this problem by writing a basic binary manager that uses symlink under the hood. 

This project is not specific to golangci-lint, mockery. You can use any library you want. The condition is the library
must be installed via `go install` command.

**Note**: Executable binaries must be within ($GOPATH/go/bin) before using gbvm.
For example, if you installed golangci-lint via homebrew, you need to delete it first. 
You should install with `gbvm install` command. Please check demo.
